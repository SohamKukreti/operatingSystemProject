# Deadlock Prevention Algorithms implemented using semaphores
### What are deadlock prevention algorithms:
Algorithms that prevent processes from getting stuck in a situation where they can't complete their tasks.

### Algorithms implemented:
1. One-shot Algorithm
2. Repeated One-shot (Multishot) Algorithm
3. Hierarchical Algorithm
4. Hierarchical Algorithm (with queue)

## Running on your system:
clone and bash run.sh in yo terminal
or just run main.exe
